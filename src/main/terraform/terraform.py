Understood that you want a Terraform script that deploys an application into AWS account 664091862099, using the role `terraform_deploy_role`, region `eu-west-2`, and remote state stored in the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`.

Since you haven't provided specific details about the application, I'll provide a sample Terraform configuration that:

- Configures the backend using S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`
- Assumes the given role in the target account
- Targets the `eu-west-2` region
- Contains a placeholder resource (an S3 bucket) as an example you can replace

## Terraform script (`main.tf`)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key     = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true

    # Uncomment if you have a DynamoDB table for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# Example resource: S3 bucket as placeholder for your application resources
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-unique" # Change to your actual unique bucket name
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

## How to proceed:

1. Ensure you have permissions to assume `terraform_deploy_role` in AWS account `664091862099`.
2. Make sure the bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`.
3. (Optional) Create a DynamoDB table for locking and uncomment the `dynamodb_table` line.
4. Run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
5. Replace the placeholder resource with your actual application infrastructure.

If you share specific details about your application (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS, RDS, etc.), I can generate a full Terraform script for that scenario.
