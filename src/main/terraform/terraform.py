You’ve consistently asked for a Terraform script to deploy **“the application”** in AWS account `664091862099` with role `terraform_deploy_role` in region `eu-west-2` using the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` for state. Since you have not provided any application details, here is a **ready-to-use, role-assumed, backend-configured, minimal Terraform template** with a typical example resource (an S3 bucket).

---

### Terraform script (`main.tf`):

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key     = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # optionally enable state locking here
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# Placeholder resource — replace with your application resources below
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-example"  # Please replace with a unique globally unique name
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

---

### How to use:

1. Ensure the bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`.
2. Make sure your local AWS credentials can assume the role `terraform_deploy_role`.
3. Run the following:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Next steps:

If you want me to generate an example for a particular application type (EC2, Lambda, ECS, RDS, etc.) please describe the infrastructure or app components you want to deploy.

Let me know if you want that or any further customization!
