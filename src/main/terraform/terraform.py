Certainly! Below is an example Terraform script that assumes you want to:

- Use the AWS provider configured to `eu-west-2`
- Assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in the AWS account `664091862099`
- Use a specific S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` for remote state storage (which I'll also configure)
- Deploy a simple example application (for demonstration, let's say an EC2 instance) under that configuration

You might need to customize the resource part (the application deployment) according to your actual application details.

### Terraform Script: `main.tf`

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    # Optional encrypt and dynamodb table for state locking
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"  # create if you want state locking
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  # Assume role in the target account
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformDeployedAppServer"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Backend**: Uses the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2` to store the state.

2. **Provider**:
    - AWS region: `eu-west-2`
    - Assumes the role: `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.

3. **Resource**:
    - Launches an EC2 instance running the latest Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI.
    - `t3.micro` instance type (free tier eligible).

### How to Use:

1. Initialize Terraform with the backend:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

---

### Notes:

- Ensure your local environment or CI pipeline credentials have permission to assume the `terraform_deploy_role` in the target account.
- The S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` must exist and be accessible.
- You might want to create a DynamoDB table for state locking in the bucket region and add it to the backend config (`dynamodb_table`).
- Adapt the resource section to your actual application (ECS, Lambda, EKS, etc.)
