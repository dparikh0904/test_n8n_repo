Certainly! Below is a more complete Terraform example that:

- Configures the AWS provider to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`
- Uses the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in the `eu-west-2` region as the backend for storing Terraform state
- Deploys a basic example application (an EC2 instance running latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS AMI)
  
You may replace the application resource with your actual app resources.

### Terraform Script: `main.tf`

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment and configure if you use DynamoDB for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu_2204" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_instance" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_2204.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformDeployedAppInstance"
  }
}
```

### How to Use

1. **Ensure prerequisites:**
   - The S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in the `eu-west-2` region.
   - Your AWS credentials configured locally or in your CI/CD system have permission to assume `terraform_deploy_role` in the target account.
2. **Initialize Terraform:**

```bash
terraform init
```

3. **Plan and Apply:**

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

---

### Next Steps

- Replace the `aws_instance` resource with your real application deployment (e.g., ECS task, Lambda function, EKS cluster).
- Optionally, add security groups, IAM roles, key pairs, or other necessary resources.
- Set up a DynamoDB table for locking to avoid concurrent state changes:
  
```hcl
# Create DynamoDB in your deployment account or manually
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

- Add the `dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"` parameter under your S3 backend configuration.
