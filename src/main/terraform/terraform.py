Certainly! Since you’ve asked multiple times for a Terraform script that deploys **the application** in AWS account `664091862099`, using `terraform_deploy_role` in `eu-west-2` region, with the remote state in S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`, but didn’t specify the application details, I’ll provide a **complete, generic Terraform script template** that:

- Configures the backend with the specified bucket
- Configures AWS provider with role assumption in the target account & region
- Includes a sample placeholder resource (S3 bucket) you can replace with your app resources

---

### Terraform configuration example — `main.tf`

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key     = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # Optional: uncomment if you use locking
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# ===== Example placeholder resource =====
# Replace below with your actual application resources

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "application_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-app-bucket-664091862099"  # Replace with unique bucket name
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### How to use this script

1. Verify that the bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`.
2. Confirm you have permission to assume `terraform_deploy_role` in target account.
3. Run Terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Need More Specific Resources?

If you want concrete Terraform resources for a **specific type of app infrastructure** (EC2, ECS, Lambda, RDS, API Gateway, etc.), please provide details and I can help generate that!
