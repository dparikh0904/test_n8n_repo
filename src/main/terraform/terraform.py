Certainly! Here's a minimal Terraform script to deploy an example EC2 instance (as a placeholder for "the application") in AWS account `664091862099` by assuming the role `terraform_deploy_role`, using AWS region `eu-west-2`, and storing Terraform state in the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment and configure if you wish to use DynamoDB for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical account owner ID
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform_Deployed_App"
  }
}
```

### Usage Instructions

1. Ensure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in the `eu-west-2` region.
2. Your local AWS credentials (or CI/CD environment) must have permission to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```
