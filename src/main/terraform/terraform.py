Certainly! Below is a Terraform script example that will deploy your application in AWS account `664091862099`, assuming the role `terraform_deploy_role` in region `eu-west-2`, and use the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` for storing Terraform state.

Since you asked just for a "deploy the application" script without specifying details about the application itself, I will create a simple example resource (an S3 bucket) to demonstrate deployment. You can replace this with your actual application resources.

### `main.tf`

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Optional locking table - remove/comment if you don't have one
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# Example resource - Deploy an S3 bucket as part of your app
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "App Bucket"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "app_bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket deployed for the application"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
}
```

---

### How to use:

1. Make sure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`. If you want locking, create a DynamoDB table (like `terraform-locks`) and specify it in the backend.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
3. This will assume `terraform_deploy_role` in the target account and deploy the example S3 bucket.

If you provide details about the actual application resources (e.g., ECS service, Lambda, EC2, RDS), I can tailor the script accordingly.
