Certainly! Hereâ€™s a Terraform script that:

- Uses the S3 backend bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in the `eu-west-2` region to store Terraform state,
- Configures the AWS provider to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`,
- Deploys a simple example resource (an S3 bucket as a placeholder for your application).

Replace the example resource with your actual application as needed.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment the following line if you have configured a DynamoDB table for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "AppBucket"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the application S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
}
```

### How to use:

1. Make sure the bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`.
2. Ensure `terraform_deploy_role` exists in account `664091862099` and your current credentials allow assuming it.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

If you want me to generate the script for a particular AWS service or more complex app setup, just provide details.
