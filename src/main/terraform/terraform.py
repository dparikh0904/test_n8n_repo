Certainly! Below is a Terraform script that assumes a cross-account deployment scenario where you will assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in AWS account `664091862099` and deploy resources in the `eu-west-2` region. The script will:

- Assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in the target account.
- Use this assumed role to deploy resources.
- Use `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` as the S3 backend bucket (for state storage).

**Important Notes:**

- You need local AWS credentials or environment variables of an IAM identity that has permission to assume the `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
- The role `terraform_deploy_role` must trust the account/user running this script.
- The S3 backend bucket (`terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`) must already exist with appropriate permissions set or be created before the first backend initialization.
- You might want to modify this example to include the actual application deployment resources.

### Example Terraform Setup

#### 1. `provider.tf`

This file configures the AWS provider to assume the role in the target account and sets the region.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "TerraformSession"
  }
}
```

#### 2. `backend.tf`

Configure Terraform remote backend to use S3 for state storage:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # Optional, for state locking
  }
}
```

Note: The `dynamodb_table` is optional but recommended for state locking to prevent concurrent writes.

#### 3. `main.tf`

An example application deployment, e.g., an EC2 instance or simple resources, just to demonstrate resource deployment.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_app_bucket" {
  bucket = "example-app-bucket-664091862099"
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### Full example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # Optional locking table
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "TerraformSession"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_app_bucket" {
  bucket = "example-app-bucket-664091862099"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### How to use

1. Make sure your current AWS credentials can assume `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
2. Ensure the backend S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` (and optional DynamoDB lock table) exist.
3. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

4. Plan and apply:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
