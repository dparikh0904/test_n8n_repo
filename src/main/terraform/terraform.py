It looks like you're asking repeatedly for a Terraform script to deploy "the application" in AWS account `664091862099`, assuming the role `terraform_deploy_role`, targeting region `eu-west-2`, with state stored in S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`.

Since you haven't specified what your application actually consists of, I'll provide a simple Terraform example that assumes the role and deploys a basic EC2 instance as a placeholder.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical official AMI owner
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-app-instance"
  }
}
```

### Instructions:

1. Make sure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in the `eu-west-2` region.
2. Your AWS CLI/profile environment should have permission to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

If you provide details about the actual application resources, I can tailor the script accordingly.
