Certainly! Here's a complete Terraform example that assumes the role `terraform_deploy_role` in AWS account `664091862099`, uses region `eu-west-2`, and configures the backend to use the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` for storing the Terraform state. This script deploys a simple EC2 instance as your example application:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks" # Uncomment if you have DynamoDB locking set up
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical AMI owner
}

resource "aws_instance" "application" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyTerraformDeployedApp"
  }
}
```

### Before applying:

- Ensure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists.
- Ensure your AWS credentials have permission to assume the `terraform_deploy_role`.
- Run:
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```
