Hello! You've asked multiple times for a terraform script to deploy "the application" into AWS account `664091862099` assuming the role `terraform_deploy_role` in `eu-west-2` with S3 backend bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`. Since the actual application specifics haven't been provided yet, I'll create a reusable Terraform template that:

- Assumes the given role in the target AWS account
- Uses the eu-west-2 region
- Uses the requested S3 backend
- Deploys a simple placeholder EC2 instance as an example app deployment

---

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks" # Uncomment if you have locking set up
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical official AMI owner
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleApp"
  }
}
```

### Instructions

1. Create the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` (if not present).
2. Ensure AWS credentials used locally or in CI/CD can assume `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
3. Initialize and apply:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

If you want me to customize this for a specific application stack (like ECS, Lambda, EKS, RDS, etc.) please share details!
