Sure! Since you repeatedly request a Terraform script to deploy "the application" in AWS account `664091862099` by assuming the `terraform_deploy_role` role, targeting the `eu-west-2` region, and storing state in the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`, Iâ€™ll provide a basic but complete example you can customize.

---

### Assumptions:
- You have an S3 bucket named `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2` for Terraform remote state.
- The IAM role `terraform_deploy_role` exists in account 664091862099 and your current credentials can assume it.
- No specific application details are given, so I'll include a placeholder resource (S3 bucket) to demonstrate deployment.

## Complete Terraform Script:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment and specify if you use DynamoDB for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform_deploy_session"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "AppBucket"
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}

output "deployed_bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the deployed S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
}
```

---

### How to use:

1. Ensure the backend bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`.
2. Place the above code in a file named e.g. `main.tf`.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

This will deploy a private S3 bucket named `app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2` by assuming the specified IAM role.

---

### Next steps:

- Replace resource `aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket` with your actual application infrastructure (e.g., ECS cluster, Lambda, etc.).
- Add variables, modules, outputs as needed.
- Configure state locking with DynamoDB if you want to enable concurrency safety.

If you want me to generate Terraform code to deploy a particular app stack or AWS service, please provide those details!
