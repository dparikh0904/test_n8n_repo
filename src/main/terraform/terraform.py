Understood. Below is a generic Terraform script that:

- Assumes the role `terraform_deploy_role` in AWS account `664091862099`
- Uses the `eu-west-2` region
- Uses the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` for storing Terraform state
- Deploys a simple example resource (an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) as a placeholder for your "application"

Replace the EC2 resource with your actual application resources as needed.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment if using DynamoDB locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformAppInstance"
  }
}
```

**Instructions**:

1. Create the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2` if it does not exist.
2. Ensure your local AWS credentials have permission to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in the target account.
3. Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

If you provide details about the exact "application" you're deploying, I can tailor the script accordingly.
