Certainly! Below is a Terraform script example that demonstrates how to deploy an application in the AWS account `664091862099` using a specified assume role `terraform_deploy_role` in the `eu-west-2` region. The script will create resources under (or using) an S3 bucket named `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` for storing Terraform state and locking.

### What this script includes:
1. Backend configuration to store Terraform state in the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2`.
2. Provider configuration for AWS specifying the region and assuming the `terraform_deploy_role` role into `664091862099`.
3. A simple example resource to demonstrate deployment (you can replace it with your real application resources).

### Prerequisites:
- The S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` must already exist in `eu-west-2`.
- The role `terraform_deploy_role` must exist in account `664091862099` and must have trust policy allowing the caller to assume it.
- Your local credentials or environment must have permission to assume that role.

```hcl
# terraform.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"               # Optional: for state locking (create DynamoDB table or remove this line)
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# Example deployment resource: deploy an AWS S3 bucket for your app (replace with your real app)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "App bucket"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "app_bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket for the app"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
}
```

### Explanation:

- **terraform backend**: stores state in S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2`.
- **provider**: uses the `assume_role` block to switch into the given IAM role in the target account.
- **resource**: example resource to create an S3 bucket for your app deployment, replace with the actual resources as needed.

---

### How to use:

1. Save the above in `main.tf`.
2. Make sure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists.
3. (Optional) If using DynamoDB for state locking, ensure the table `terraform-locks` exists.
4. Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This will deploy the app resources in the specified AWS account and region using the assume role.
