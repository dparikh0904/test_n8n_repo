Certainly! To create a Terraform script that deploys an application **in AWS account 664091862099**, assumes the **terraform_deploy_role** role in that account to gain permissions, uses the **eu-west-2** region, and stores the Terraform state under the S3 bucket **terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099**, here's a basic example.

---

## What the script will do:
- Configure the **S3 remote backend** to store state.
- Use the **AWS provider** with **assume_role** to deploy into the target account.
- Create a simple AWS resource (an S3 bucket) as a placeholder for "application" deployment.

## Terraform Script

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    # The bucket where Terraform state is stored
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"

    # Path within the bucket to store this app's state file
    key    = "application/terraform.tfstate"

    region = "eu-west-2"

    # Enable encryption at rest
    encrypt = true

    # Uncomment and set if you use DynamoDB for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# Example Application Resource: S3 Bucket (replace with your app resources)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"

  acl = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "ApplicationBucket"
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}

output "app_bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the deployed application bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.id
}
```

## Usage Instructions:

1. Ensure the **S3 bucket** `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2` (for remote backend state).
2. Ensure the IAM role **terraform_deploy_role** exists in account `664091862099` and your current AWS credentials allow you to assume it.
3. Create a directory, e.g., `terraform-app`.
4. Inside that directory, save the above code as `main.tf`.
5. Initialize terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
6. Preview the resources to be created:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
7. Apply the deployment:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

---

## Notes:
- Replace the example `aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket` resource with your actual application AWS resources (e.g., ECS, Lambda, EC2 etc.) as required.
- If you manage state locking, uncomment and configure the DynamoDB lock table in the backend block.
- The backend bucket and role must be pre-configured beforehand.
