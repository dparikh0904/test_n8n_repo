Certainly! Below is a Terraform configuration file snippet to deploy an "application" (represented here as an EC2 instance) into AWS account `664091862099` by assuming the role `terraform_deploy_role` in the `eu-west-2` region. It also configures Terraform state backend using the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical official AMI owner
}

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "deployed-application"
  }
}
```

### How to use:
1. Make sure the bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in AWS region `eu-west-2`.
2. Your executing credentials must have permissions to assume the `terraform_deploy_role` role in AWS account `664091862099`.
3. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to deploy.
