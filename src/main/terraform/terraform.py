You’ve asked multiple times to create a Terraform script to "deploy the application" in AWS account `664091862099` with `terraform_deploy_role` in the `eu-west-2` region, using `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` as the backend. However, you haven’t provided any specifics on what the application includes (e.g., EC2 instances, Lambda functions, RDS instances, ECS services, etc.).

---

### I will provide a **complete Terraform starter template** that:

- Uses the specified backend
- Assumes the specified role
- Is configured for the `eu-west-2` region
- Contains a placeholder example resource (S3 bucket) — please replace it with actual application resources.

## Terraform Script (`main.tf`)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true

    # Uncomment and update if you use DynamoDB for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# Placeholder resource: Replace this with your actual application resources

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-app-bucket-664091862099" # Replace with a globally unique bucket name
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "prod"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### Usage Instructions

1. Make sure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2`.
2. Ensure your AWS IAM user/role has permission to assume `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
3. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

4. Preview plan:

```bash
terraform plan
```

5. Apply changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

### If You Provide Details…

If you provide the details of your application infrastructure — e.g.:

- EC2 instances (AMI, instance type, counts)
- Lambda functions (source code or S3 location)
- ECS services or tasks
- RDS databases
- VPC/subnets/security groups
- API Gateway, Load Balancers, etc.

—I can tailor the Terraform script to deploy that application exactly.
