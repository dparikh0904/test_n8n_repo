Certainly! Below is a complete Terraform configuration that:

- Uses the S3 backend `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2` for remote state.
- Configures the AWS provider to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
- Deploys a simple example resource (an S3 bucket).  
You can replace the example resource with your actual application resources.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment if you use DynamoDB for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}

output "app_bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the deployed S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
}
```

---

### Usage

1. Ensure the backend bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists and (optionally) the DynamoDB table for state locking is created.
2. Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Terraform will assume the specified role in account `664091862099` and deploy the resources in `eu-west-2`.
