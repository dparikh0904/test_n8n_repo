Certainly! Below is a minimal Terraform example that:

- Uses the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2` for remote state
- Configures the AWS provider to assume the role `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`
- Deploys a simple example application (an S3 bucket named `app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2` â€” you can replace this with your real application resources)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key    = "app/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # Uncomment if you have DynamoDB table for state locking
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "App Bucket"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "app_bucket_name" {
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
  description = "The name of the created S3 bucket"
}
```

---

### Usage:

1. Ensure the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in the `eu-west-2` region.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
3. This will assume `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099` and deploy the resource.
