Certainly! Here is a concrete and complete Terraform script that assumes the role `terraform_deploy_role` in AWS account `664091862099`, deploys to the `eu-west-2` region, and stores the Terraform state in the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`.

Since you haven't specified your application's resources, this example creates a placeholder S3 bucket. You can replace or extend it with your actual resources later.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key     = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks" # Uncomment if you use DynamoDB for state locking
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-deploy-session"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-eu-west-2"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "AppBucket"
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.app_bucket.bucket
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket created for the application"
}
```

### Usage

1. Make sure that the S3 bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` exists in `eu-west-2` and is configured for Terraform state.
2. Ensure the IAM role `terraform_deploy_role` exists in account `664091862099` and your credentials have permission to assume it.
3. Save the above code in a file (e.g., `main.tf`).
4. Run the following commands to deploy:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

If you share details of your actual application (e.g., EC2, ECS, Lambda, RDS, etc.), I can tailor the script to deploy that application specifically.
