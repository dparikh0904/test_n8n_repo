It seems you're requesting a Terraform script to deploy an "application" to AWS account `664091862099` assuming the role `terraform_deploy_role` in region `eu-west-2`, using the backend bucket `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099`. However, you have not specified what your application consists of â€” such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, ECS services, RDS databases, or something else.

---

### Here's a **minimal Terraform setup template** you can start with:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket  = "terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099"
    key     = "application/terraform.tfstate"
    region  = "eu-west-2"
    encrypt = true
    # dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"  # Uncomment if you use DynamoDB for state locking
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  assume_role {
    role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::664091862099:role/terraform_deploy_role"
    session_name = "terraform-session"
  }
}

# === Replace the below resource with your application's resources ===

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_bucket" {
  bucket = "app-bucket-664091862099-example"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### How to proceed

- **Create the Terraform backend bucket** `terraform-scripts-deployment-664091862099` in `eu-west-2` if it doesn't exist.
- **Ensure your AWS credentials have permissions** to assume the `terraform_deploy_role` in account `664091862099`.
- **Replace** the example `aws_s3_bucket` resource with the resources that comprise your application.
- Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### If you specify your application infrastructure (e.g., EC2, Lambda, ECS, RDS, etc.), I can generate a fully tailored script for it.
